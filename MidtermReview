3 Distance between two points in space = End - Start 
4 Delta = End - Start 
5 Difference between two points 
6 Length between the two points is called the magnitude which is derived using the Pythagorean theorem a^2+b^2=c^2 
7 Find steering force using magnitude between max velocity vector  
8 and desired location using Pythagorean theorem= steering force acceleration. 
9 Seek !uses this steering force behaviour, a few other steering algorithms 
10 flee:!hide:arrive:!wander:! PathFollow! Obstacle Avoid:! evade:! Pursuit:! flocking:! separation, cohesion, alignment

20 Finite State Machine: behaviours that can be swapped in and out 
21 Enter:adding a behaviour 
22 Execute:doing the behaviour 
23 Exit:removing the behaviour 
24 
25 FuzzyLogic = adding a weight to a steering behaviour  (or any kind of decision making process) 
26 by degree of membership (how strongly to weight merged steering behaviours) 
27 example: flee*2f+seek*3f

29 Graph: List of Nodes and edges (node a position, edge cost to travel to another node) 
30 usable in navigation graphs , decision trees, 
31 Dijkstra: does all the searches considers all possibilities until it finds its search O(N^2) operation for one node 
32 for an entire graph it would be N*O(n^) = 0(n^3) whenever the graph changes 
33 Heuristic(just a best guess at what is right or wrong, simple rule which we use to make decisions quickly, 
34 but it can be confounded and causes trouble) 
35 A*: has a heuristic value and searches in its general direction to avoid exhausted searches.  
36 feels like Log(n) whenever you need to do a search 
37 usually in navigation graphs uses distance between where you are and where you think you should be 
38 better with large data and dynamic data

40 Good AI:  
41 Step 1: make it perfect (reflexes are faster, pathing is better, makes better decisions than the player) 
42 Step 2: make it randomly fail (if the randomness can be set then you can scale the difficulty, 
43 less random more difficult, more random less difficult)

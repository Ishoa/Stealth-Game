Mid Term Review

Distance between two points in space = End - Start
Delta = End - Start
Difference between two points
Length between the two points is called the magnitude which is derived using the pythagorean theorum a^2+b^2=c^2
Find stearing force using magnitude between max velocity vector 
and desired location using pythagorean theorum= steering force acceleration.
Seek !uses this steering force behavior, a few other steering algorithms
flee:!
hide:
arrive:!
wander:!
PathFollow!
Obstacle Avoid:!
evade:!
Pursuit:!
flocking:! separation, cohesion, alignment

Finite State Machine: behaviors that can be swaped in and out
Enter:adding a behavior
Execute:doing the behavior
Exit:removing the behavior

FuzzyLogic = adding a weight to a steering behavior  (or any kind of decision making process)
by degree of membershio (how strongly to weight merged steering behaviors)
example: flee*2f+seek*3f

Graph: List of Nodes and edges (node a position, edge cost to travel to another node)
usable in navigation graphs , decision trees,
dijkstra: does all the searches considers all ossibilities until it finds its search O(N^2) operation for one node
for an entire graph it woudl be N*o(n^) = 0(n^3) whenever the graph changes
Hueristic(just a best guess at what is right or wrong, simle ule which we use to make dicisions quickly,
but it can be confounded and causes trouble)
A*: has a hueristic value and searches in its general direction to avoid exhausted searches. 
feels like Log(n) whenever u need to do a search
usually in navigation grapsh uses distance between where you are and where you think you should be
better w large data and dynamic data

Good AI: 
Step 1: make it perfect (reflexes are faster, pathing is better, makes better decisions than the player)
Step 2: make it randomly fail (if the randomness can be set then you can scale the difficulty,
less random more difficult, more random less difficult)
